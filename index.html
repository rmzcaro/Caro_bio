    <h1>About Carolina "Caro" Ramirez </h1>

    <p>My name is Carolina Ramirez, I am originally from Coahuila, Mexico. 
        I enjoy dancing, writing, being outside and eating. I have tried to all of 
        these at the same time, without luck, so far. I've lived in Houston for 
        four years and don't mind the heat. I try to scout out the best places to 
        eat everywhere I go - yelp and a growing network of foodies have been
        my loves. </p>
